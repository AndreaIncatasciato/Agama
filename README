This is the C++ library for action-based modeling of galaxies.

Its main tasks include:

  - Computation of gravitational potential and forces;
  - Orbit integration and analysis;
  - Conversion between position/velocity and action/angle coordinates;
  - Distribution functions;
  - Framework for dealing with observational data and selection functions;
  - Framework for finding best-fit parameters of a model;
  - Auxiliary utilities (e.g., various mathematical routines).

The library is structured into several levels with clearly defined interfaces:

  - Lower-level interfaces:
    * Unit conversion (see units.h for details)
    * Coordinate conversion (coords.h)
    * Math routines (math_***.h, also in WD_***.h)
    * Configuration files, string manipulation, error reporting, etc. (utils_***.h)

  - Intermediate-level interfaces:
    * Gravitational potentials (potential_***.h)
    * Orbit integration (orbit.h) and analysis [not yet part of the library]
    * Particle collections and handling of N-body snapshots (particle_***.h)
    * Selection functions (sf_***.h)
    * Distribution functions (DF) expressed in terms of actions (df_***.h)

  - Higher-level interfaces:
    * Action/angle finders (conversion from position/velocity to action/angle)
      and action/angle mappers (reverse conversion) - action_***.h

  - Still higher-level:
    'Galaxy Model' - a combination of gravitational potential, action finder, and DF
    (galaxymodel.h), with the following features:
    * Moments of distribution functions (density, velocity ellipsoid)
    * Generation of N-body models and mock observations
    * Fitting the model to the data
    * Self-consistent models (potential/density pair corresponding to the given DF)

In addition, there is a Python interface to some of the library classes and routines.

Test programs that check the correctness of various parts of library,
and demonstrate its usage, are in a separate folder (tests).

Instructions for compilation are in the file INSTALL.
