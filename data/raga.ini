##### global parameters of the simulation #####

# input file name: to create a file in this example, one may use
# mkspherical density=Plummer out=plum16k.dat nbody=16384
fileInput=plum16k.dat

# total simulation time in N-body units
timeTotal=2560

# duration of one episode (determines the frequency of potential and distribution function update)
episodeLength=32

##### potential parameters #####

# order of angular expansion (even number, 0 implies spherical symmetry)
lmax=0

# number of grid points in radius (default value 25 is usually reasonable)
gridSizeR=25

# enforce a particular degree of symmetry (spherical, axisymmetric, triaxial, etc)
symmetry=triaxial

# mass of the central black hole or the combined mass of the binary black hole
#Mbh=0.01

# semimajor axis of the binary black hole (0 means no binary)
#binary_sma=0.01

# mass ratio between two components of the binary (0 means no binary)
#binary_q=1

# eccentricity of the binary
#binary_ecc=0

##### parameters controlling the simulation ingredients #####

# two-body relaxation rate ( ln Lambda / N_star, where
# ln Lambda ~ 10 is the Coulomb logarithm,
# N_star is the number of stars in the physical system being modelled -
# not necessarily the number of particles in the simulation.
# 0 turns off two-body
relaxationRate=5e-4

# number of points sampled from each particle's trajectory during one episode:
# larger value decreases the discreteness noise in potential recomputation
numSamplesPerEpisode=16

# whether to update the stellar potential after each episode
updatePotential=true

# loss-cone radius: if a black hole is present, and the capture radius is >0,
# any particle approaching within the given distance will be captured.
# in case of a black hole binary, each component has its own radius.
#captureRadius=1e-5
#captureRadius2=1e-5

# fraction of mass of captured particles added to the black hole mass
captureMassFraction=1

# speed of light in N-body units - determines gravitational-wave losses by the binary black hole
speedOfLight=0

##### output settings #####

# interval between writing out the output snapshots,
# potential expansion coefficients, and relaxation model
# (should be an integer multiple of episodeLength)
outputInterval=32

# file for storing diagnostic information (default is "fileInput".log)
fileLog=plum16k.log

# file for storing output snapshots

# file for storing potential coefficients (timestamp is appended to the name)
fileOutputPotential=plum16k_pot

# file for storing relaxation model (timestamp is appended to the name)
