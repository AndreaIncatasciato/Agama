# total simulation time, measured in relaxation units:
# to obtain the time in N-body units, multiply by relaxationRate.
# For the Plummer model, the half-mass relaxation time is given by
# t_rh = 0.206 scaleRadius^(3/2) mass^(-1/2) [N / ln Lambda],
# where the term in square brackets is the inverse relaxationRate factor.
# For our choice of scaleRadius, t_rh=0.093 relaxationRate^-1, so by assigning
# the value 0.093 to relaxationRate, our time unit is equivalent to
# the half-mass relaxation time.
# we expect the core collapse to occur at 15.5 t_rh, i.e. shortly before our end time
# (it won't be reached, since the program crashes after the core radius shrinks
# to the innermost grid cell).

# the factor determining the overall time scale;
# its value is \ln\Lambda / N_\star,  where
# ln Lambda is the Coulomb logarithm and N_star is the number of stars or particles in the system.
# Since the relaxation time is the only dimensional quantity if the evolution is considered
# in the orbit-averaged approximation, the results are invariant w.r.t rescaling of time,
# so we are free to set this factor to whatever value, and we take the value that makes
# our time unit equal to the initial half-mass relaxation time.
